Data is a huge aspect of the CSP exam. The 3 aspects of data tested on the AP exam are: date tools, big data,bais in leaning machine. We will be just talking about data tools in this one!

First, lets talk about data tools. Data is everywhere, social media apps collect data about our posts and our likes. Online stores collect data about the products we view. Advertising agencies collect data about what we click. There are a few options that help us store data. 
1) text files
* Have you ever played a video game? In all those games, your score or the number of kills are all stores in a text file. 
* Data is this form in known as tabular data, and is usually arranged in comma seperated values(CSV)

<p>
The first line in the file declares the columns "id", "username", and "level". As you can see, they are all seperated by commas. 
There are a few disadvatages to this data, first of all, the file can become HUGE. The computer's hardrive might not have enough data to store the information. 
  
  2) Spreadsheets 
  
  * A spreadsheet is a tool for storing, organizing, and analyzing data. 
  *A wide range of people use spreadsheets, since they can analyze data without needing any programming skills.
  
  3.) Databases 
  
  * database, a system that stores data that can be easily created, read, updated, and deleted. (More on the on the SQL and CRUD operation page) 
  *SQL is most often used to interact with the data base. 
  On the CSP exam, you do not need to know SQL, you just need to know how to understand and analyze data, lets look at an example.
  
  4.) Guided Practice
  * Please click on this link: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/ap-cs-p-example-high-scores/6444620373917696
  * As you can see, we can create, insert, and select here. 
  * The database has multiple tables so that one can store differnt types of data. 
  * The read application can filter diifernt profiles. 
  
  5.) Important vocab: 
  vocab that you need to know for the APCSP exam: 
  * Lossy data- Compressing data in a way that throws some data away and makes it almost impossible to recover the original, great compression, like JPEG images
  * Lossless- Compressing data in a way that preserves all data away and allows full recovery of the original, good compression
  * Metadate- data about data, like a camera storing the location, aperture, shutter speed, etc. for a digital photo (subsection of the data) 
There are VITAL defintions. On the AP exam, a sample question can be: Which on the following is metadata? We had a couple of these types of question on the practice so make sure you know your defintions. 
  
  6.) Finding patterns in data 
  
  This is rather intuitve and there are the "easy points" that you can get on the Ap exam. 
 
  A.) Vizulaization with charts 
  <p align="center">

<p>
As you can see, there is a clear downward trend. One can make safe inferences on this trend. It would be safe the say that there will be less children from women is 2020 than 2015. As you can tell, these are rather simple. There are question on this exam that are easy point so make sure you get them! 

A. Pracice question
 <p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/9e1ad3721162023eb3df2048d5e1a9794e2342c0.png" />
<p>
What trends are apparent in this chart?
  
  A) A downward trend from January to mid-May, and an upward trend from mid-May through June.
  
  B)An upward trend from January to mid-May, and a downward trend from mid-May through June.(CS)
  
  C) No particular trends
  
  D) The graph diverges 

  The correct answer is B! Hopefully you got the right answer. 
  
  Sometimes there is a bit of fluctuations in the data, to understand the correalation, we must use a line of best fit.

<p>
  There is still an overall postive correlation as eviednced by the line of best fit. The line of best fit can also let you extrapolate the data. 
  
  7. Making Predictions 
  One must look at statistical trends and make accurate conclusions 
  Lets look an example: 
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/images/charts/colleges/american-university-tuition-fees-chart.jpg" />
<p>
 
  * A fesible conclusion is that the price for college is increasing. 
  * But something unreasonable is that the price is increasing 20k every year. 
  * belive it or not these do show up on the ape exam and you ability to analze teands will help!
