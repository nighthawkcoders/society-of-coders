The internet is something that a lot of students think they know everything about. However, there are a few things 
that we need to dive into. We will be talking about the Ingredients of the internet, the connection of networks, and 
IP adress in this lesson. 

A. Ingredients of the Internet 
* The Internet is a global network of computing devices communicating with each other in some way via email or sharing websites. 
* The Internet is known as an open network: anyone can use it as long as you dont break the rules.
* In internet jargon, protocols are the rules that must be followed and they define how how each device communcates with each other.

 There are a few things that we need inorder to have a global network of computing devices. 
  
  * Wires & wireless: Physical connections between devices, plus protocols for converting electromagnetic signals into binary data.
  * TLS: A secure protocol for sending encrypted data so that attackers can't view private information.
  * IP: A protocol that uniquely identify devices using IP addresses and provides a routing strategy to send data to a destination IP address.
  * TCP/UDP: Protocols that can transport packets of data from one device to another and check for errors along the way.
 
  You may not need to know many of these acronyms for the AP exam but they are important to know inorder to get the bascis down! 😉
  
  B. Computing Networks 
  *  computer network is any group of connected connected devices that that can send and recive data. 
  
  Lets look at 2 devices:

<p>
  * For these 2 devices, we just need to find a way to create a connection where these 2 computers can communciate!
  * The arrangment is obviously rather simple, lets make it a little harder 🙃
  
  Lets take a look at 6 devices and how we can connect the devices:

<p>
  
  * The different combinations are called: network topology (This came up on MC's on the AP exam before) 
  
  C. Types of networks 
  
  These are rather inititve so lets dive right in! 
  
  * Local area network (LAN):  a network that covers a limited area like a house or school. This is probably the one most of us have unless you have some kind of secret society! 🧐
  * Wide Area Network (WAN), a network that extends over a large geographic area and is composed of many, these are composed of many LAN's

<p>
  *  Data Center Network (DCN), a network used in data centers where data must be exchanged with very little delay, so like in government offices!
  
  Quick Check For Understanding: 
  
  What type of network is the internet? 
  
 A: Im going to save you the suspense! The internet is a WAN because it is mostly all arounf the world. 
  
  D. IP Adress 
  
  Hopefully this is the one that all of you guys were waiting for, because all of us have Ip adresses. In movies 
  you may have seen people track people based on someone's Ip adress. Let's dive right into Ip adresses! 
  * Internet Protocol (IP) is one of the core protocols in the layers of the Internet, its used in most internet communications to handle adressing and routing. 
  * Think of the Ip adress as your adress, poeple from amazon need your adress to deliver your stuff, similarly nternet-connected devices need an IP address to receive messages
  * When one computer communicates with another one, it has to  specify the recipient's IP address and also include its own IP address so that the second computer can reply

  This for our favorite thing is CS, math! Dont very, its super simple! 
  
  E. IP v4 Adress 
  * In IPV4 protocal, Ip adress looks like this: 74.125.20.113 (try visiting it! Huge shocker btw) 
  * The IP adress can range from 0-255 
  * [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]
  * coverted to bianary: 01010101 01010101 01010101 01010101
  * each number can repersent values to 2^8 (octets)
  * This means that there is 2^32 possibilties 
  
  The internet got so popular that we had more than 2^32 devices, ik its incredible! So we needed to create a new way, introdcuing.. 
  
  F. IP v6 addresses
  * Ip V6 format: 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
  * Notice that there are hexidecimal numbers here! 
  * FFFF would be the highest adress, since F is the highest  digit in Hex. 
  * In total, each IP v6 address is represented by 2^128 IPv6 adresses: this is 340 undecellion. (hopefully we dont need a new method!)
 
  Note: If there are some error or you would like to add stuff, please feel free to! This is used to help you and your classmates tackle the Ap exam!
