Variables are used in code to store values to shorten code and to simplify code. They can store a variety of values: integers, floats (numbers with decimal places), strings, user inputs, boolean values, and more.
A string is a character or a list of characters. 
For example, we can create the variables x, y, and z, and assign them to certain values as seen below:

```
x = 14
y = "Hello world!"
z = 1.345
```

Print statments can be used to print strings as well as variables. Here are a few examples:

```
variable = 1234

print("hi")
print(variable)

OUTPUT:
hi
1234
```

Variables can also store a user input. The value that the user inputs is saved to a string by default. For example we can set the variable "user_input" to this:

```
user_input = input("What is your favorite color?")
```

It will ask the question "What is your favorite color?" in the terminal and the user will be able to type their response and press enter.
For example, if the user types "purple" the variable user_input will be assigned to the string "purple".
Here is some example code for the situation described above.

```
user_input = input("What is your favorite color?")
print("Your favorite color is " + user_input + ".")

INPUT:
purple

OUTPUT:
Your favorite color is purple.
```

These variables can be used in a variety of ways to simplify code and become a big part of more complex code.
