Threats and Security ideas are also a big topic in the AP Computer Science Principles exam. 

The most common threat that they will talk about is phishing. I've seen so many questions on this. They will ask something like "Which of the following is mostly for a phishing attack" or "How can you tell if something is a phising attack" or something along those lines. A phishing attack is when a bad person sends you a false email from a company that you might know about. However, they add certain viruses inside the links to put on that email to do bad things. The way to realize if something is a phishing attack is to make sure you look through the email and make sure it is actually legit. Phishing attacks also have numerous typos throughout the email which you should be able to easily see. Also, if you hover over the link, you can see if the link actually redirects to the page they stated or if it is some website you don't know about.

The next thing they talk a lot about is cookies. Cookies are the things that go into websites to take your data. This allows companies to do multiple things with it. The first one is to sell those cookies to other companies so that they can send specific advertisements directly to you in hopes that you might buy something. Another reason someone might take your cookies is to display recommendations or things like that. This is usually not much of a security issue, but it is something that is there sometimes because the test might ask you "how can cookies be misused" and you can say "because they take your data" or something like that.

Another thing that is common is personal information. They ask a lot of questions about something that could do with personal information like SSN, name, email, etc. and they ask you how someone could take your information and use it incorrectly and things like that. This isn't usually that big but they might ask something like "which of these can be considered personal information"

Some other things they might ask about is something like a keylogger. A keylogger is just something that downloads onto your computer and records all your keystrokes to take something like your username and password. 

Another thing is a Rogue Access Point. This is when your data is sent over public networks so they can easily be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. Rogue access points can do this and steal data. 

One thing is also malware. Malware is a malicious software intended to damamge a computing system by controlling its opierations. These can easily spread and basically just destroy your computer completely. 

The last thing is Computer Viruses. A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer which will then do some harmful activity on your computer. 

Try to remember these different threats because collegeboard usually gives a few questions on those. 

Hope this helped!
