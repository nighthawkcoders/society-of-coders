This may seem like a poinless topic, but trust me is shows up a lot on the AP exam. Espically on the multiselect ones. 

A. Copyright laws 

* copyrighted-  This  means they are the intellectual property of the creator, think of patenets 
* There are cetain right that are gives to the ownders. 
* The right to reproduce their work
* The right to create derivative works
* The right to distribute copies by sale or rental
* The right to publicly display visual works
* The right to publicly perform audio works via digital transmission

Most copyright in the US last 70 years. 
* after the copyright expired, the work enters  the public domain, and can be used and adapted by anyone without restriction.
There are 4 questions that someone can ask to determine fair use, this can be a way to bypass copyright infringment cases. 
* What's the purpose and character of the use? (person vs. educational) 
* What's the nature of the copyrighted work
* How much of the copyrighted work is used, and how significant is that portion of the copyrighted work
* What's the impact of the use on the potential market for and value of the copyrighted work

This prevents someone from suing thier teacher because they wrote a paragraph straigh out of the textbook becasue thier 
motive was educational. 

If a non-profit educational website uses a paragraph from a history book in an article, it is likely to be considered fair use. If a commercial entertainment website streams an entire historical drama from a film studio, it is almost certainly not fair use.

B. Copyright in the Digital Age 

* In the 1990's, there was a new app
* Many of those MP3 files were digital recordings of copyrighted music; Internet users were happy to finally have a way to listen to hundreds of their favorite songs for free.

  * Napster was suddenly facing three lawsuits for enabling copyright violations
  * This was becasue the music they are playing were copyrighted 
  
  C. Digital Rights management 
  * That's why some copyright owners are a fan of digital rights management (DRM): tools that restrict where and how a user can use copyrighted media.
  * Spotify adds a DRM layer to streamed songs which prevents their subscribers from listening to the songs anywhere besides Spotify apps.
  * he DRM layer scrambles the audio data in a way that only the Spotify player understands how to unscramble 
  * Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) which criminalizes the production and distribution of technology that tries to circumvent DRM
  
  D. Open source 
  * For creative works such as writing and multimedia, copyright owners can apply one of the Creative Commons licenses. For software, programmers can apply an open source license. Any type of creative work can be made available in the public domain.
  * Thanks to that CC license, the non-profit organization LearningEquality is able to share our content in Kolibri, an app that is designed for offline use and brings educational content to learners that don't have high-speed Internet access or modern computers
